*** Building and Installing ***
*******************************
Before running the 'make' command, you will probably have to modify the
makefile_profile.mak file.  Ideally you will only have to modify the CC_ROOT
variable.


***************************
*** Chronos Watch Files ***
***************************
The repository includes the files
  - chronosbutton.c
  - chronosbutton.py

The .py file is a python script example that was found at:
  http://chemicaloliver.net/programming/receiving-ti-ez430-chronos-button-presses-in-processing-and-python/

I took the Python script and converted it to run in C.


*****************************
*** Chronos Watch Drivers ***
*****************************
In order to use the RF access point with the BeagleBoard, it was necessary to make
sure that the following options/modules were set to a "Y" in the Linux kernel config:
  - USB Modem (CDC ACM) Support
  - USB Serial Converter Support
    - USB TI 3410/5052 Serial Driver
An example kernel that should work on the BeagleBoard with the Chronos watch
is in the repository (uImage-chronos)
